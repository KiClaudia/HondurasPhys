# HondurasPhys
analysis for honduras 2022 field samples collected from gumbalimba, meridian, and grand roatan (phys). 

Testing from github
Testing from rstudio

# Some questions we will attempt to answer:
1) Does BCI and sex affect any of the phys measures?
2) Correlate female follicle size and number with phys (separately)
3) Are there differences in phys measures based on site?
4) Are there differences in BCI/SV/MASS based on site?

BCI script created, calculate BCI for females and males, created new data sheet based on it CSV.

BCIphysFem script created. use to check if BCI affects phys measures for female. didn't check assumptions, used this as prelimiary test. will check again when running actual regression for each phys variable
